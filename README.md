## Here are ten intermediate-to-advanced Ansible project ideas, each designed to boost your skills with practical applications and hands-on configuration management:

## 1. Automated LAMP Stack Deployment
Objective: Automate the deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on multiple servers.
Steps:
Create an inventory file to define target hosts.
Develop playbooks for installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP, including configuration files.
Implement handlers to restart services on changes.
Test idempotency by running the playbook multiple times.
Skills Gained: Multi-host deployment, idempotency, configuration templating.
## 2. Centralized User Management System
Objective: Manage users across multiple Linux systems from a central playbook.
Steps:
Define an inventory of servers to manage.
Create a playbook to add, update, or delete users and groups.
Store user information in a variable file or vault for security.
Configure sudo privileges and SSH access for each user.
Skills Gained: User management, security, data protection with Ansible Vault.
## 3. Infrastructure Monitoring Setup with Prometheus and Grafana
Objective: Deploy and configure Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring server infrastructure.
Steps:
Write playbooks for installing and configuring Prometheus and Grafana.
Set up custom dashboards in Grafana and configure data sources.
Use Jinja templates to manage Prometheus configurations for scraping targets.
Automate the addition of new nodes to the monitoring stack.
Skills Gained: Monitoring setup, templating, dynamic inventory management.
## 4. Configuration Drift Detection and Remediation
Objective: Use Ansible to detect and automatically remediate configuration drift.
Steps:
Develop playbooks that define desired configurations.
Schedule the playbooks to run periodically using cron or Ansible Tower.
Set up notifications to alert if configurations change.
Include automated rollback functionality for non-compliant configurations.
Skills Gained: Compliance, automation with schedules, rollback mechanisms.
## 5. Automated SSL Certificate Renewal with Let's Encrypt
Objective: Automatically obtain and renew SSL certificates using Ansible and Certbot.
Steps:
Develop playbooks for installing Certbot and generating SSL certificates.
Schedule automatic renewals and configure Nginx/Apache to use updated certificates.
Set up email notifications for renewal status.
Skills Gained: SSL/TLS management, scheduling with cron, secure automation.
## 6. High Availability Web Cluster with Load Balancer
Objective: Deploy a highly available web application with a load balancer.
Steps:
Use Ansible to provision multiple web servers.
Configure a load balancer (e.g., Nginx or HAProxy) with automated backend registration.
Set up health checks and failure handling for web nodes.
Automate the scale-up and scale-down of web nodes.
Skills Gained: Load balancing, HA setup, scaling.
## 7. Automated Backup System with Recovery Testing
Objective: Automate backups and verify recovery steps.
Steps:
Write playbooks to back up critical files/databases to secure locations.
Schedule periodic backups and implement a naming convention for easy retrieval.
Test restoration and document the steps as a playbook for disaster recovery.
Skills Gained: Backup automation, recovery testing, job scheduling.
## 8. Dynamic DNS Management and Configuration
Objective: Automate DNS configuration using a cloud providerâ€™s API (e.g., AWS Route 53, DigitalOcean).
Steps:
Use Ansible modules for your chosen cloud provider to manage DNS entries.
Implement conditional logic to add, update, or delete DNS records.
Automate updates to reflect server IP changes.
Skills Gained: Cloud integration, dynamic inventory, API handling.
## 9. Zero-Downtime Application Deployment with Rolling Updates
Objective: Enable continuous deployment with rolling updates for applications.
Steps:
Create playbooks to deploy updates in batches to ensure minimal downtime.
Implement health checks after each batch.
Use serial, max_fail_percentage, and batch_size to control deployment speed.
Roll back changes if health checks fail.
Skills Gained: Continuous deployment, batch processing, error handling.
## 10. Self-Healing Infrastructure with Ansible and Monitoring Alerts
Objective: Automatically resolve common issues detected by monitoring tools.
Steps:
Integrate with a monitoring system to trigger Ansible playbooks on alerts.
Create playbooks to resolve common issues, like restarting services or clearing disk space.
Log all actions and include error handling to prevent loops.
Skills Gained: Event-driven automation, monitoring integration, self-healing mechanisms.
These projects cover a broad range of skills, from infrastructure automation to cloud integration and compliance management. Working through them will deepen your Ansible expertise and give you a robust set of skills in automation and DevOps. Let me know if you want further guidance on any project!
