Objective: Enable continuous deployment with rolling updates for applications.
Steps:
Create playbooks to deploy updates in batches to ensure minimal downtime.
Implement health checks after each batch.
Use serial, max_fail_percentage, and batch_size to control deployment speed.
Roll back changes if health checks fail.
Skills Gained: Continuous deployment, batch processing, error handling.
## 10. Self-Healing Infrastructure with Ansible and Monitoring Alerts
Objective: Automatically resolve common issues detected by monitoring tools.
Steps:
Integrate with a monitoring system to trigger Ansible playbooks on alerts.
Create playbooks to resolve common issues, like restarting services or clearing disk space.
Log all actions and include error handling to prevent loops.
Skills Gained: Event-driven automation, monitoring integration, self-healing mechanisms.
